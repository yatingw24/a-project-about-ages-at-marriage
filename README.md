# This is a final project for my Foundations class at J-School. It is a very basic webpage, and I will definitely continue working on this.
## I used Flask to create a website that allow people to browse gender differences in terms of their age at first marriage across countries.
## The data comes from World Bank
## Things I'd like to add/improve:
### insert a chart showing gender difference for each country;
### use gender as a secondary filter

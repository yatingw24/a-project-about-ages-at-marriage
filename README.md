# This is a final project for my Foundations class at Columbia J-School. 

## It is a very basic webpage

## Goals:
### 1. using Flask to create a website that allow people to browse gender differences in terms of their age at first marriage across countries.
### **The data comes from World Bank

## Things I'd like to add/improve:
### insert a chart showing gender difference for each country;
### use gender as a secondary filter
